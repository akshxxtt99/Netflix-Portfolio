# Netflix-Portfolio
A Netflix-inspired developer portfolio featuring a cinematic dark theme, hero video background, and project cards arranged like content rows. Built using HTML and CSS, it showcases my personal projects in a clean, responsive, and visually engaging layout while highlighting my frontend fundamentals and UI design skills.
